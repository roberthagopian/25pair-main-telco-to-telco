<h2>25-Pair Main Telco to Telco Connection</h2>
  This lab helped me gain an understanding of how commercial voice systems are structured. Particularly running 25-pair inside plant cable from the entrance (Main Telco Room) 110 Block to the secondary Telco Room distribution blocks. This cabling connects the Entrance Room to adjacent Telco Rooms which are next to the Work Area.
<br /> 
<br />
  
First, I ran the 25-Pair horizontal backbone cabling from the Entrance Room to the adjoining Telco Rooms. Measuring and accounting for slack, I Marked and Taped both ends.
Next up, I started by terminating my 25-pair cable to the Telco Rooms IDC 110 Block.

Note: I needed to add Five 5-Pair Connecting Blocks on the top row of the Telco Room 110 block using the 5-Pair Punch Down Tool. (non cutting end)

Once everything was neatly organized I moved to the Main Telco Rooms distribution block, installing the 5-pair connecting blocks here as well. I made sure to Identify my pairs and blade orientation was correct and then got to work on terminating the pairs to the Main Telco Rooms 110 block.

<br />

This process is actually terminating a cable carrying OUTBOUND signals to Telco Rooms. The INBOUND signals enter the 110 block via the 100-pair cable on the right side of the block. The first 25 Pair was terminated on the bottom of Row 1, the second group on the top of row 4. The OUTBOUND cables will be terminated following the IMPORTANT PRINCIPLE of direction when laying cable. -->

- <b>In on the Left, Out on the RIght</b>
- <b>In on the Bottom, Out on the Top</b>
- <b>In on the Top, Out on the Bottom</b>
